## Game Inputs
If you've wondered how many times you jumped while playing any Mario game, or ducked in a Sonic game to initialize a spin dash (depending on the game), these scripts tell you just that. You can just download them and run them to check specific inputs per game. I am currently only lightly and slowly working on them as I figure out how to get different checks for different inputs; you can, however, use these as a base to work on your own.

## Premise for this
I just wanted to try different ideas using Python for small projects and getting practice in the language. Outside of school courses, I rarely had the time or creativity to work on something, especially since I always wanted to do something big to start rather than going at it in small steps; so this is what I'm doing. Just trying out any simple idea that pops in my head and figure out how I would go about doing it with Python, being that it is a powerful tool for whatever you can think of.

Enjoy, I guess! c:
